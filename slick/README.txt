3. Open up ajaxtabs/ajaxtabs.js

Line 7 - Rplace http://xoopsexperts.com/demo/ with your domain


4. Upload slick theme folder to your theme directory. 


And that's it!




Notes:

- To change the way the tabs or content area looks, refer to the ajaxtabs.css in the "ajaxtabs" folder.

- By changing some of the css values you can change the way the tabs or content area displays.

- Please keep the link to XoopsExperts.com in the theme footer OR link back to XoopsExperts.com from any other page on your site. Thanks!


Non-Ajax Tabbed Installation:

1. Just open up the file "theme_notabs.html", and save it as "theme.html", overwriting this file. You can then delete "theme_notabs.html", as well as the "ajaxtabs" and "menupages" folder, as you won't need these files for the plain theme.
